We collect information in three main categories.

### 3.1. Account & Profile Information

## 6. How We Share Your Information

We do **not** sell your personal data. We share your data only with:

### 6.1. Service Providers & Infrastructure

We use third-party providers to run PhotoSense, for example:

- **Firebase / Google Cloud** (Firestore, Storage, Authentication, Analytics, Crashlytics, etc.)  
  - To store your account, content, and app data.

- **RevenueCat** (planned)  
  - To manage in-app purchases and subscriptions through Apple App Store and Google Play.
  - We do **not** store your payment card details ourselves; payments are handled by Apple, Google, and/or RevenueCat’s integration.

### 6.2. AI Providers

To generate insights from your photos, we may send data to:

- **OpenAI**
- **Anthropic**

We **do not** directly upload your image files to these providers. Instead, we send **public or access-controlled URLs** or metadata for processing, along with text instructions. The provider then analyzes the image and returns structured or textual results.

We use these providers as processors to generate insights for you.

### 6.3. Sharing with Other Users Inside PhotoSense

PhotoSense allows you to **share insights** within the app:

- Shared insights are **only visible to authenticated users** of PhotoSense.
- When you share an insight, it may show:
  - The **insight content** (ratings, text feedback, etc.).
  - Your **display name** (or profile name), if configured.

You are in control of which insights you choose to share.

### 6.4. Legal Reasons

We may disclose information if we believe in good faith that it is reasonably necessary to:

- Comply with applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request.
- Protect the safety, rights, or property of PhotoSense, our users, or the public.
- Detect, prevent, or address fraud, security, or technical issues.

## 7. Data Retention

We generally keep your information for as long as your account is active.

- **Account data, photos, and insights**  
  Stored for as long as you have an account and do not delete them.

- **When you delete an insight or photo**  
  We intend to delete the associated content from storage and database (or irreversibly de-identify it) within a reasonable period, subject to backups and technical limitations.

- **When you delete your account**  
  We delete or anonymize:
  - Your account.
  - Your photos and insights.
  - Other personal data associated with your account.

- **Logs and diagnostics data**  
  We may retain logs for a longer limited period **after account or content deletion** for:
  - Security and fraud detection.
  - Debugging.
  - Legal compliance.  

These logs are periodically deleted or anonymized.

Exact retention periods may vary depending on legal requirements and technical constraints.

## 8. International Data Transfers

Because we use cloud providers (such as Firebase, OpenAI, Anthropic), your data may be stored or processed on servers located **outside of Türkiye**, including in the EU, US, or other countries.

We take reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and that appropriate safeguards are in place where required by law.
